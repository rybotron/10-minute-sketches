10-minute-sketches
==================

A collection of Rybotron's short brain exercises for creative and technical stimulation. Sometimes created in 10 minutes or less and sometimes more. Example sketch types (hopefully) will be Quartz Composer, After Effects, Cinema 4D, Touch Designer, and Processing.

Check out www.rybotron.com or www.facebook.com/rybotronic for more information and images of the sketches.
